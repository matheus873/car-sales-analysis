1.	Project Background and Description
 	Our group will explore and analyze the critical factors such as Covid-19, unemployment, interest rates, and the stock market regarding car sales volume changes.  We will also analyze automobile brands as it pertains to their standing in the stock market.
2.	Potential Storylines
 	Potential investors hired the team as a financial analyst to wrangle data from sources (state sources) to determine if now is a safe time to invest in certain automobile brands and determine if that brand will surpass the pandemic.
OR

A financial newspaper has hired the team to develop data and visualizations to give their readers tools and tips for wise stock buying decisions.
